# PBRestimation
•	calling_program_for_simulation_runs.R is the «master code” that distributes the simulations onto many cores.

•	oneSimRun.R is the “submaster code” which calls the different functions for first simulating, then analyzing the data.

•	simulation_functions_myseed.R contains all the functions needed to simulate data.

•	analysis_functions_sep_robustvar_fix.R contains all the functions needed to analyze data.

• makeplot.R sample call of functions from analysis_functions_sep_robustvar_fix.R to make a plot (requires a dataset I have not posted yet to GitHub)

•	(outdated) parallelTest_clustermq_....R is the «master code” that distributes the simulations onto many cores.
